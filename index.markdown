# Temporary Club Closure

**Because of you-know-what, we've had to halt practice for the time being. But we'll be back as soon as we can! See you then.**

We practise <a href="http://www.wanomichi.net/" target="ext">Wanomichi</a>, a variant of Traditional Aikido, in Perranwell, near Truro, Cornwall. The club is a member of the <a href="http://aikidoresearchfederation.co.uk/" target="ext">Aikido Research Federation</a> and the instructor is qualified with the <a href="https://www.bab.org.uk/cms/" target="ext">British Aikido Board</a>. He holds third dan certificates in Wanomichi, given by Sensei Daniel Toutain, a direct student of Morihiro Saito Sensei.

Aikido is a Japanese martial art that teaches how to harmonise yourself with an attacker’s movement and intention. This art promotes awareness, agility, balance, confidence, and a peaceful mind. It improves physical and mental health. There is no competition in Aikido - instead, we help each other to improve. There is no need for physical strength in this art - instead we work to increase our skill. Aikido practitioners relax, both in the dojo and in everyday life.

“Aikido has nothing to do with brute strength, weapons, or war.
It is the Art of Peace.”

Morihei Ueshiba,
Founder of Aikido.
