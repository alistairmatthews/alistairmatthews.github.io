# Practising in 2025

**If you want a new challenge for this New Year, you'd be very welcome to join our club and learn this fascinating and rejuvenating art. To see what it's like, take a look at [a typical session](https://player.vimeo.com/video/859473234?h=c67904da52). We've already restarted at <a href="http://maraziontowncouncil.gov.uk/our-community/community-hall/" target="ext">Marazion Community Hall</a> on Friday evenings. See the [Practise with Us](practise.markdown) page for more details.**

We practise Traditional Aikido in Marazion, near Penzance, Cornwall. The club is a member of <a href="http://aikidoalive.co.uk/" target="ext">Aikido Alive</a> and the instructor is qualified with the <a href="https://www.bab.org.uk/cms/" target="ext">British Aikido Board</a>. He holds third dan certificates in <a href="http://www.wanomichi.net/" target="ext">Wanomichi</a>, given by Sensei Daniel Toutain, a direct student of Morihiro Saito Sensei.

Aikido is a Japanese martial art that teaches how to harmonise yourself with an attacker's movement and intention. This art promotes awareness, agility, balance, confidence, and a peaceful mind. It improves physical and mental health. There is no competition in Aikido - instead, we help each other to improve. There is no need for physical strength in this art - instead we work to increase our skill. Aikido practitioners relax, both in the dojo and in everyday life.

"Aikido has nothing to do with brute strength, weapons, or war.
It is the Art of Peace."

Morihei Ueshiba,
Founder of Aikido.
