I"Ã<p>Weâ€™ve been using Instagram for a few months to post short videos that demonstrate what weâ€™ve been studying. And they been followed and liked quite a bit by other Aikidokas of Insta. Weâ€™d also like them to help promote what we do to potential students so if you have a Cornish community of seekers after fitness and spiritual progress, please link to it. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/konpontekina/" target="ext">This is our feed</a></p>
