<p>We practise <a href="http://www.wanomichi.net/" target="ext">Wanomichi</a>, a variant of Traditional Aikido, in Perranwell, near Truro, Cornwall. The club is a member of the <a href="http://aikidoresearchfederation.co.uk/" target="ext">Aikido Research Federation</a> and the instructor is qualified with the <a href="https://www.bab.org.uk/cms/" target="ext">British Aikido Board</a>. He holds third dan certificates in Wanomichi, given by Sensei Daniel Toutain, a direct student of Morihiro Saito Sensei.</p>

<p>Aikido is a Japanese martial art that teaches how to harmonise yourself with an attacker‚Äôs movement and intention. This art promotes awareness, agility, balance, confidence, and a peaceful mind. It improves physical and mental health. There is no competition in Aikido - instead, we help each other to improve. There is no need for physical strength in this art - instead we work to increase our skill. Aikido practitioners relax, both in the dojo and in everyday life.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAikido has nothing to do with brute strength, weapons, or war.
It is the Art of Peace.‚Äù</p>

<p>Morihei Ueshiba,
Founder of Aikido.</p>
