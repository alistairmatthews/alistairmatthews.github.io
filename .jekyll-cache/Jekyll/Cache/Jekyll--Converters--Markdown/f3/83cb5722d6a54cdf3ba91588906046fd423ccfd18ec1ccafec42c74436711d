<p>We practise traditional Aikido in Perranwell, near Truro, Cornwall. The club is a member of the <a href="http://aikidoresearchfederation.co.uk/" target="ext">Aikido Research Federation</a> and the instructor is qualified with the <a href="https://www.bab.org.uk/cms/" target="ext">British Aikido Board</a>.</p>

<p>Aikido is a Japanese martial art that teaches how to harmonise yourself with an attacker’s movement and intention. This art promotes awareness, agility, balance, confidence, and a peaceful mind. It improves physical and mental health. Aikido
practitioners relax, both in the dojo and in everyday life.</p>

<p>“Aikido has nothing to do with brute strength, weapons, or war.
It is the Art of Peace.”</p>

<p>Morihei Ueshiba,
Founder of Aikido</p>
